# Password-Generator

## Description
People are always in need of a secure password that satisfies password complexity conditions. This random password generator will create a password for the user based on the character types they wish to include. The beauty of this random password generator is that your password will be secure and it won't include making easy to guess words and/or phrases. I learned the importance of pseudocoding and that your first iteration of a solution won't always be your last.
